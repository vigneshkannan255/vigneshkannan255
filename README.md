# ðŸ’« About Me:
Hi, Iâ€™m VigneshKannan, a passionate Security Engineer with over 3 years of experience in Infrastructure Operations. I have a strong focus on Cybersecurity, and Iâ€™m dedicated to ensuring that organizations build secure, resilient systems. My interests are rooted in DevSecOps, where I strive to integrate security into every stage of the development process, helping teams build secure applications from the ground up.<br><br>Iâ€™ve had the privilege of working in dynamic environments where Iâ€™ve honed my skills in risk management, threat mitigation, and incident response. As I continue to grow in my career, Iâ€™m driven by a desire to stay ahead of emerging cybersecurity threats and to continually improve the security frameworks I work with. My goal is to help bridge the gap between development, security, and operations, ensuring that security is both efficient and seamless in modern infrastructure.
